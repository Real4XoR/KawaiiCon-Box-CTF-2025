# Challenge 1 - Lock Picking

First box contains multiple locks of varying difficulty i.e. bluetooth smart padlock, regular standard pin padlack, security pin padlock etc.

# Challnge 2 - Smart Camera

Have a local web server run on ESP32 and a blacked out box adjacent to the main box. Main box only has a wireless network to connect to and a URL where the webapp is hosted. Will be vulnerable and users have to get access to the smart camera and swivel it within the blacked out box to identify the code for a combo padlock.

# Challenge 3 - NFC Cracking

Setup a vulnerable NFC reader with a crap password or magic code. Let users try and crack it or read it off an existing card.
